## 🐇>About me
I'm a software developer and computer scientist from Saskatchewan, Canada!<br/>
<br/>
I've been learning to program since 2024 (In CST at Saskatchewan Polytechnic), but i've been interested in working with computers and learning about them since I was very young.
As a developer I enjoy working in object oriented languages the most (C# and Java in particular), but I'm still learning and once I get around to it I feel like I might enjoy more low level languages like C++.
I also love working with computers more generally. For example, computer hardware and building PC's is a huge interest of mine, and I hope one day I'll have the money to build my dream PC.
Outside of software development I enjoy playing videogames and developing mods for those games in my free time, but you probably didnt come here to read about my hobbies, so I'll get into some details on my experience next.

## 📖>Languages I Know
As mentioned before I have a particular interest in backend development and object oritented languages, but that doesnt mean thats all I know.
Here's a list of languages I've worked in ordered from most to least favorite, as well as the (rough) ammount of time I've worked with that language:
1. C# (1 Year)
2. Java (2 Years)
3. HTML (2 Years)
4. Python (< 1 Year)
5. CSS (2 Years)
6. Javascript (2 Years)

## 🏢>Some of my work
Incase you don't want to take me at my work, here's some of my projects you can check out to see some of my work:
* [QuestPDF push to .NET 9](https://github.com/BTELNYY/QuestPDF)
  * A quick fork of a PDF generation library from to push it from .NET 8 to .NET 9 that me and a friend quickly made for for me to use in a seperate project for a client at Saskpolytech
*  [Computer Systems Technology year 1 end of year project](https://github.com/hash-bunny/cst-student-project-prjblue2025)
  * This was my year end project me and a group of my classmates made for the end of our first year at Saskpolytech
