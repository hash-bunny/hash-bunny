## 🐇>About me
I'm a software developer and computer scientist from Saskatchewan, Canada!<br/>
<br/>
I've been learning to program since 2024 (In CST at Saskatchewan Polytechnic), but i've been interested in working with computers and learning about them since I was very young.
As a developer I enjoy working in object oriented languages the most (C# and Java in particular), but I'm still learning and once I get around to it I feel like I might enjoy more low level languages like C++.
I also love working with computers more generally. For example, computer hardware and building PC's is a huge interest of mine, and I hope one day I'll have the money to build my dream PC. 
I enjoy working in a team, but I'm still able to manage myself and take charge of development tasks when needed. One of my favorite aspects of development is solving complex problems programitcally, and I'm always happy to
break down and explain my code or assit in developing a plan to solve a difficult coding problem.
Outside of software development I enjoy playing videogames and developing mods for those games in my free time, but you probably didnt come here to read about my hobbies, so I'll get into some details on my experience next. 

## 📕>My Skills
As mentioned before I have a particular interest in backend development and object oritented languages, but that doesnt mean thats all I know.
Here's a list of languages I've worked in ordered from most to least favorite, as well as the (rough) ammount of time I've worked with that language:
1. C# (1 Year)
2. Java (2 Years)
3. HTML (2 Years)
4. Python (< 1 Year)
5. CSS (2 Years)
6. Javascript (2 Years)<br/>

I also have experience with several other aspects of development such as:
* GIT and GIT management
* Database creation, development, and managment
* Development frameworks and enviroments like:
  * Blazor (C#)
  * Entitiy Framework Core (C#)
  * React (Javascript)
  * Sequalize (Javascript)
  * Node.JS (Javascript)
  * Android Studio (Java)
* Rapid Prototyping with Figma
* Agile Development Style

## 🏢>Some of my Projects
Incase you don't want to take me at my work, here's some of my projects you can check out to see some of my work:
* [QuestPDF push to .NET 9](https://github.com/BTELNYY/QuestPDF)
  *  A quick fork of a PDF generation library from to push it from .NET 8 to .NET 9 that me and a friend quickly made for use in a seperate project for a client at Saskpolytech. This was wasn't a difficult update to make but it gave me some valuable experience modifying open source code to better fit my needs
* [Computer Systems Technology year 1 end of year project](https://github.com/hash-bunny/cst-student-project-prjblue2025)
  * This was my year end project that me and a group of my classmates made for the end of our first year at Saskpolytech! This gave me some valuable experience working in full stack development and working in a larger team.
* [Web Development 280 Final Project](https://github.com/hash-bunny/cweb_final_project)
  * This was my final project for my Web Development 280 class at Saskpolytech where I made a simple blogging website. Unlike my year end project from my first year I was able to use more libraries and make a mostly production ready, stateful website. I learned a lot about managing API's and authentication and autorization making this.
